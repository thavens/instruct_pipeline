Merge related or conditional instructions.

You can begin your response with some thinking, then respond with each clause inside its own <clause>...</clause> xml block.
It's possible there are no instructions at all, in which you should not write any <clause>...</clause> xml tags.

Edit them as necessary to capture relevant context, or merge closely related ones. Respond with each clause inside its own <clause> block.
